<h3>  <p>  <strong>Present</strong></p></h3>
<h4><p>From 2011 to 2016, the drawing system expanded from a mere stylus to one with a tablet system. After the stylus were tablets for beginner artists or photo editors. These tablets remained in the Wacom Bamboo or Intuos series. Unlike the product only consisting of styluses, a graphic tablet board is attached. This enables users to use the tablet as a surface to write or draw. The information set out from the stylus onto the tablet is transmitted and displayed onto to the computer. Currently, however, Wacom has developed a new drawing tablet, where artists are able to look and draw directly on the screen, rather than draw without looking at the tablet. The recent design developed is known as, “Cintiq.”
</p>
<p>Cintiq is a pen and touch display with an advanced interface design that allows user to draw directly on a screen which displays visuals with “true-to-life color on a high-resolution display.” Compared to previous designs, the Cintiq tablet has greater specs and tools addressed to professional artists and digital designers, and displays higher color accuracy and sensitivity.
</p>
<p>Attached with the tablet is a remote called, “The ExpressKey Remote.” Unlike previous tablets, the controls are separated from the tablet, so the remote allows users to “scroll, zoom, and rotate” conveniently and efficiently at the individual's’ own comfort. The Cintiq tablet also comes with a stylus with functionalities that show maximum precision and sensitivity designed for drawing, painting, image editing, or even 3D animation. Artists are also able to adjust their nibs, the tips of the stylus, to their own preference, which adds a lot of character and suitability to the artist’s individual needs.
