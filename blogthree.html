        <strong>Designing Interface Animation</strong>
    <p>	The article, “Designing Interface Animation,” by Val Head, introduces the importance of animation and branding in terms of storytelling and personality. Head directs the outcome of particular branding to be based on how designers interpret and incorporate their creativity and techniques to form a storyline that addresses to a certain cause. This allows the audience to identify the personality of several projects and how their branding impacts them.  Head suggests that individuals should first visualize a blueprint of their design and strive to obtain an overall idea of the type of image they aimed for. This process is known as the “motion audit,” where clips meant to be animated are cropped and combined.
	<p>I had a lot of trouble understanding the motion audit step, mostly about its mechanics and technicalities. How does motion audit contribute to Head’s theme regarding the figurative meaning of personality within branding and animation? Followed by the motion audit step is the evaluation of one’s animation’s purpose. In this, individuals should identify a clear image or attribute that they would like to attach to animation. By isolating adjectives that describe the brand, designers would be able to create more of a thematic focus on the content that they wish to symbolize. </p>
	<p> The article greatly helped me with associating certain animations to emotions. For instance, wobbly bouncing figure can depict “friendliness or playfulness,” whereas, a figure that bounces everywhere can evoke chaotic and unstable emotions. </p>
