         <h3>LITTLE RED</h3>
         <p>This piece was inspired by the short story, "Little Red Riding Hood." It utilizes vectors created from Adobe Illustrator. In this piece, I had trouble figuring out how to fill in shapes based on its lineart. To resolve this, I researched how to fill in shapes when the bucket tool did not work and found out that by using the "Live Paint" in Illustrator, I was able to render the shapes made and fill them in. This was all done in one layer per shape; however, so it was difficult to distinguish between shapes, especially the ones that had openings and were incomplete. Some of the shapes were also removed and overlapped with solid colors due to the openings. Overall, the result came out as a success, despite the problems met and reduction in shapes.
