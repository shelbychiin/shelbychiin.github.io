        <strong>Critique of a Website</strong>
<p>  Website: League of Legends – Worlds History by Resn</p>
<p>  <a href="http://promo.lolesports.com/en_US/worlds/history">League of Legends History</a></p>
<p>The opening of this website really draws in the audience as the background music and animation creates a “hype” and dramatic atmosphere that represents a significant part of the computer game, “League of Legends,” the Worlds Championship. This is where representatives from all over the world within various servers come together to compete to be the best team.
  This website acts as a collection of the previous championships, an overall history of them in other words. </p>
  <p>The presentation of this website follows the idea of “Worlds Championship,” something global. The smooth animation takes the audience on a journey through a galaxy in which the timeline follows a constellation theme. This greatly compliments the global aspect of the content and guides the audience in following the competition throughout the year of that game season. The website isn’t hard to follow, and beginners can definitely browse with ease.
  The visuals are eye-catching and definitely capture the essence of the competition. Some are not limited to their borders and have some features popping outside of it to make it look less flat. As you scroll down, there is a simplistic animation of one image connecting to another like a constellation. The color of the background is dark, so images overlapped on top of it are brighter and pop out more. Definitely a great color scheme. </p>
<p> <strong> Pros: </strong>
  <li>Animation is smooth and attention-grabbing</li>
  <li>Galaxy theme is beautiful and relevant to topic (including bgm)</li>
  <li>Location of links are easy to find, so beginners are able explore with ease</li></p>

  <p><strong> Cons: </strong>
  <li>I would add more variation to font style and size in order to keep the viewer interested in the description.</li>
  <li>Touch up the quotations to make it at the beginning and end of the phrase rather than above and below it. </li>
  <li>Have a tab section where one can easily choose which year to read the history rather than keep on clicking left and right </li></p>
