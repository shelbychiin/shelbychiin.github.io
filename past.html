<h3>  <p>  <strong>Past</strong></p></h3>
<p>	Technology is constantly advancing and developing while revolving around the concept of human-centered design; however, one in particular, vastly and significantly impacts the digital design field and expertise, a drawing tablet. A drawing tablet is a type of digital art board that connects to a system (computer) that allows individuals to write or draw on the tablet surface with a stylus, and have the information transferred and displayed onto a screen. One of the most common drawing tablets purchased and used currently is the Wacom drawing tablet. Masahiko Yamada, founder of Wacom, established the company on July 12, 1983 and strove to further the creative process and expand the compatibility of devices with universal programs that utilized the same inking language, while providing a “variety of graphical tools and features.” Despite the Wacom tablet seeming to have originated from a pair of devices (tablet and stylus), it actually began as a sole product. </p>
<p>The drawing tablet did not start out as a digital art board with a stylus, rather it began as a mere stylus. Inventor Elisha Gray first developed the product known as a, “telautograph.” According to the article, History of Pen and Gesture Computing, author Jean Renard Ward describes the telautograph as a system that transmitted electrical information recorded from a pen to a receiving station. Gray attached servomechanisms to a pen or pencil, and by moving the tool, the visuals and movements formed are transmitted to another system, where the pen connected to that system is reproduced accurately. Aside from greatly impacting the design field, this product affected the medical field as well. Doctors utilize the product and are able to send and receive signatures quickly regarding approval of patient information and doctor’s orders. </p>
<p>	The idea of transmitting information from a pen onto another machine is greatly modified and developed for convenience and efficiency. Yamada, the founder of Wacom, optimized the stylus to pair with mobile devices in 2011. The digital pen utilized an advanced sensor system that allowed users to access applications in a short amount of time and provided a wider interface, where buttons did not take up most of the space of the phone. The Galaxy Note series were the first smartphones to incorporate Wacom touchscreen technology. It enabled users to “air command” by merely hovering over the screen with the stylus known as the “S Pen” and accessing to a “set of five features” that made tasks easier. With the S Pen, users can also draw and write on a small screen, as well as multitask through a “small application window.” </p>
