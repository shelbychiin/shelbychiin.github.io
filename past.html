<h3>  <p>  <strong>Past</strong></p></h3>
<h4><p>	The drawing tablet did not start out as a digital art board with a stylus, rather it began as a mere stylus. Inventor Elisha Gray first developed the product known as a, “telautograph.” According to the article, History of Pen and Gesture Computing, author Jean Renard Ward describes the telautograph as a system that transmitted electrical information recorded from a pen to a receiving station. Gray attached servomechanisms to a pen or pencil, and by moving the tool, the visuals and movements formed are transmitted to another system, where the pen connected to that system is reproduced accurately. This product is the predecessor to a fax machine. Aside from greatly impacting the design field, the telautograph beneficially affected the medical field as well. Doctors utilized the product and were able to send and receive signatures quickly regarding approval of patient information and doctor’s orders. The telautograph represents the origins of how tablets began to develop.</p>
<p>	The idea of transmitting information from a pen onto another machine is greatly modified and developed for convenience and efficiency. Yamada, the founder of Wacom, optimized the stylus to pair with mobile devices in 2011. The digital pen utilized an advanced sensor system that allowed users to access applications in a short amount of time and provided a wider interface, where buttons did not take up most of the space of the phone. The Galaxy Note series were the first smartphones to incorporate Wacom touchscreen technology, primarily the “Wacom feel technology.” Wacom’s contribution enabled users to “air command” by merely hovering over the screen with the stylus known as the “S Pen” and accessing to a “set of five features” that made tasks easier. With the S Pen, users can also draw and write on a small screen, as well as multitask through a “small application window.” </p>
