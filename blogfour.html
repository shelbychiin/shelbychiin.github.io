        <strong>Website Analysis of Responsive Design</strong>
    <p>The Massimobonini website (http://www.massimobonini.com/en/home/) does an excellent job in smoothly transitioning the layout to fit all desktop, mobile, and tablet use. As the site condenses, the content and images transform from a wide, grid-like collage into one column that continues to scroll down. The one column setup is visually appealing and pleasing to look at when presented in mobile view. The images and tabs are not cluttered and are organized; however, a drawback from this website view is that the pageâ€™s linked tabs are removed. One is still able to find the linked tabs as a drop down menu; however, it is not convenient to look for the menu and click the links, especially if one has a small screen. Another problem would be the location of the content under the magazine tab. The posts are aligned to the left, so as one narrows the size of the website, there is a large white space in the middle and right areas.
</p>
<p>	The images and color them on the website utilizes and focuses on blue and red primarily. The visuals are crisp and high quality and there are wide variations of font styles, making them visually appealing. The website is easy to navigate and acts as a fashion blog, so the image choices and addition of gifs make the content really pop.
